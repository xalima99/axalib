# Getting Started with Buttons

A button is component that the user can press to trigger an action. All Buttons have normal, active and disabled state.

_Normal : Normal State of Button
Active : When the Button is pressed
Disabled: When the Button is disabled_

## Primary Button

### Usage

We get this primary button by adding a **primary** prop to the button API.

````javascript
const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button icon={someIcon} primary onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>
    Primary Button
  </Button>
);
````

## Secondary Button
Used to indicate the main action of a page/form which going with the user’s decision on making this action.

### Usage

We get this secondary button by adding a **secondary** prop to the button API. 

_NB_: If by mistake you provide **primary** and **secondary** props at the same time to the same Button, then the default mode will be primary.

````javascript
const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button icon={someIcon} secondary onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>
    Secondary Button
  </Button>
);
````

## Primary Outlined Button

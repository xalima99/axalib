Similar to Hero covers used in Web design, on mobile this component serves to communicate content, accompanied by a some kind of visual element. In your mobile applications **you can use covers either with a CTA, which invites to take action, or as banners to written content.**


## Types of covers

When deciding what cover to chose, you need to consider two things - **the size available you have on the screen, and the visual media you want to use.**

## Type

You can use 3 types of media - an illustration, a photo or a video.

## Size

You can choose from 4 different sizes fro your media content, depending on the context and media you would like to use.

## Design

Using a cover can add a strong element to your mobile interface, but you should be careful on how it lives with the rest of the components on the screen in order to ensure legibility.
